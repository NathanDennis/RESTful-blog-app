### A small blog application following RESTful routing conventions
Images below

### Technologies used:
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- SemanticUI for styling

Eventually I want to flesh this out with user authentication & user account facilities

## To Do
- Refactor to use Babel for import / export
- Create login system with user authentication
- Add social links to footer (github / linkedin / personal site)
- Add proper error handling and response status codes to routes
